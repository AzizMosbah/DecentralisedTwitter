This is a rudimentary version of twitter but hey, at least it's decentralised! 

Check it out on: https://waveportal-starter-project.azizmosbah.repl.co/

It is actually deployed on ethereum's test network rinkeby in order for it not to cost any money.

Here are the steps to participate:

  1.  Get Metamask & set it on the rinkeby network
  2.  Ask for ETH on this faucet: https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby
  3.  Once your wallet is loaded you can tvveet :D




# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
